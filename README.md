# Otolith13C_hypoxia
Overview:
Scripts and processed variables for 'Hypoxia traits imprinted in otolith Î´13C from individual to global scales' (Howard and Deutsch 2024). The versions of record for the manuscript are from April 26th, 2024. Any future versions with substantive changes will be added to this repository with new dates in the file name. 

No express or implied warranty: These scripts, helper functions, and data tables are provided "as is," without warranty or guarantee of any kind. 

File descriptions:

Each primary script (HowardDeutsch_...) processes data and generates key figures and statistics from the associated manuscript.
a. HowardDeutsch_InternalCarbon processes observations of inorganic carbon system measurements from the environment and internal to a given organism to calculate pCO2. 
b. HowardDeutsch_AtlanticCodCase processes measured isotopic compositions and hypoxia traits from Atlantic cod datasets to generate comparisons of hypoxia-based predictions and observed otolith isotopic composition at the species level.
c. HowardDeutsch_PacificCodCase generates a similified life history model for Pacific cod and associated predictions of otolith isotopic composition within individuals.
d. HowardDeutsch_Global combines observed distributions of hydrographic properties, hypoxia traits, and trophic levels across many species to generate predicted distributions of otolith isotopic compositions. 
e. HowardDeutsch_GlobalCase uses the fields generated by HowardDeutsch_Global to produce associated plots and statistics for the global case study across many species. 

The folder 'Helper_Scripts_and_files' contains data tables helper functions, and toolboxes called by the primary scripts. 
a. Allometry.mat is a table of allometric scaling exponents
